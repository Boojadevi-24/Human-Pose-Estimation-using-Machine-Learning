# Human-Pose-Estimation-using-Machine-Learning
In my project, "Human Pose Estimation using Machine Learning," I develop a system that uses deep learning techniques to detect and analyze human body poses from images or videos. This solution has applications in areas such as fitness, gaming, surveillance, and motion analysis.
